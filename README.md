# Weather App ðŸŒ¦
### Introduction
This project forms part of the final, FrontEnd module at [ManchesterCodes](https://github.com/mcrcodes). The goal is to produce a simple application which takes Weather data from an API and presents it to the user in a web app.

## Project Setup
### Structure
#### index.js
As you would expect, index.js contains only the minimal amount of code required to render the App as a whole - with each component of the app written in its own file, before being imported into app.js, and finally being rendered in the DOM, in index.js. This separation of concerns is particularly important when developing a React app, as it allows you to focus on the core functionality of each component in isolation, and improves readability for anyone working on the app. 

```JavaScript
// index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./styles/index.css";
import App from "./components/App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
> Only `React`, `ReactDOM`, and the `App` itself need to be imported to the top-level of the project - with a minimal stylesheet setting out page margins. The root of the DOM is then created and bound to the `root` constant using the imported `ReactDOM.createRoot()` method. `root.render()` is then called to render the App component into the DOM.


#### App.js
In simple terms, the purpose of ```App.js``` is to import all of the individual app components, and return them in the desired order on the page, with the correct `props` passed into them so that they function as expected - so the entire App itself is a single function:

```JavaScript
import "../styles/App.css";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import LocationDetails from "./LocationDetails";
import SearchForm from "./SearchForm";
import ForecastSummaries from "./ForecastSummaries";
import ForecastDetails from "./ForecastDetails";
import getForecast from "../requests/getForecast";

function App() {...}

export default App;
```
> The `App` function is exported at the bottom of the file, ready to be rendered as a component in `index.js`.
